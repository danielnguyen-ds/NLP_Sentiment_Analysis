# Analyzing Movie Reviews Sentiment
 In this project, we will analyze 50,000 movie reviews in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) dataset and derived the sentiment for classification. We will cover multiple aspects from NLP including text pre-processing, normalization, feature engineering as well as text classification.

Different ML techniques/models will be applied to solve the problem:
- Supervised learning techniques: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines 
- Unsupervised learning techniques: Afinn, SentiWordNet, and VADER
- Deep learning models: DNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs
